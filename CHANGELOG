    * RapcTask.java (setJdeHome): remove code for locating JDE specific jar
      files to avoid causing conflicts when using project level jde.home
      property and setting jdehome property in rapc task
      (execute): add api jar to import path
      (executeRapc): get rapc jar path as local variable
