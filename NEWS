============================================
BB-Ant-Tools is poised to undergo some enhancements.  I am working on adding
two more ant tasks:

 * <alx> - generate .alx file, and corresponding directory structure
 * <jadrewrite> - updates .jad file with new set of .cod files

In addition, the rapc task will get support for selecting source files from
a text file containing a list of source files.  This will make compiling
large projects on the Windows platform possible as Windows has a limitation
on the length of a command line, thus currently limiting the number of files
that can be specified by the rapc task.

The version numbering scheme has changed as well.  The next release will be
marked 1.0.0 with following releases incrementing the minor version (1.x.0)
for minor functionality changes, and the patch version (1.0.x) for bug fix
releases.
