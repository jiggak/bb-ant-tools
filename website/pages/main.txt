## What is bb-ant-tools? ##

Blackberry Ant Tools is a collection of ant tasks for building blackberry
applications.  It's designed to be as simple as possible yet powerful enough
to completely replace the RIM JDE.  However a copy of the JDE must be
installed for the rapc and signature tool jar files.

Blackberry Ant Tools use the executable jar files to run the rapc
compiler and signature tool.  There is nothing windows specific about these
ant tasks.  If you have a copy of the JDE and the J2ME preverify command
somewhere in the path, the rapc compiler works fine on other operating
systems (Linux, Mac OS X, etc).
